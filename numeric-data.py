# Use the print() function to write the value of the variable to the shell. In the context of programming, writing means to add information to the shell.

# To get the data type of the variable, use the type() built-in function:

# To combine numbers and text, use the str() built-in function, which converts an argument into a collection of letters called a string. In this instance, you are converting the int (integer) data type into the string data type:
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))

# The int data type only stores whole numbers. If you want to store a number with a decimal, like 3.14, you need a new data type called a float.

# In advanced math, an imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number that is multiplied by the imaginary unit i. This complex data type is complicated because it must represent a letter and a number, such as 5j.
