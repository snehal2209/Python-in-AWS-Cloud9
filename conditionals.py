#Exercise 1: Working with the if statement
#In this exercise, you will edit a Python script to ship packages.
#Use the input() function to get information from the user:

userReply = input("Do you need to ship a package? (Enter yes or no) ")

#Use the if statement to print a response.
#The statements in an if statement are one tab indented from the if statement. In other programming languages, brackets are often used to indicate the start and end of a logic block, but Python uses spacing:
if userReply == "yes":
    print("We can help you ship that package!")


#Note: The == symbol is a comparative operator. It means is equal to.



#Exercise 2: Working with the else statement
#To improve customer service, it would be nice to provide a reply even if the user doesn't want to ship a package. In this exercise, you will improve the Python script by using the else statement:

#To handle the condition where the user doesn't want to ship a package, use the else statement:

else:
    print("Please come back when you need to ship a package. Thank you.")

#Save and run the file.
#At the prompt, enter no and press ENTER.
#Confirm that you see a response.
#Run the file again.
#At the prompt, enter yes and press ENTER.
#Confirm that you see a response.





#Exercise 3: Working with the elif statement
#In this exercise, you will improve the Python script by offering the user additional services. When you have multiple conditions, you can use the elif statement, which is short for else-if.

#Note: The elif statement always comes after an if statement and before the else statement.

userReply = input("Would you like to buy stamps, buy an envelope, or make a copy? (Enter stamps, envelope, or copy) ")
if userReply == "stamps":
    print("We have many stamp designs to choose from.")
elif userReply == "envelope":
    print("We have many envelope sizes to choose from.")
elif userReply == "copy":
    copies = input("How many copies would you like? (Enter a number) ")
    print("Here are {} copies.".format(copies))
else:
    print("Thank you, please come again.")

#Save and run the file.
#At the prompt, enter no and press ENTER.
#Confirm that you see a response.
#At the prompt, enter stamps and press ENTER.
#Confirm that you see a response.
    
#Run the file again.
#At the prompt, enter yes and press ENTER.
#Confirm that you see a response.
#At the prompt, enter envelope and press ENTER.
#Confirm that you see a response.
    
#Run the file again.
#At the prompt, enter no and press ENTER.
#Confirm that you see a response.
#At the prompt, enter copy and press ENTER.
#Confirm that you see a response.
#At the prompt, enter 2 and press ENTER.
#Confirm that you see a response.
    
#Note: The if, elif, and else statements allow only one path to run at a time. The program doesn’t check the other statements after it finds a condition that is true.
#As you can see, each time through the program had slightly different results. These differences demonstrate the power of conditionals.
#Congratulations! You have written a Python script that uses if, elif, and else statements.
