#To inform the user about your script, use the print() function:

print("Count to 10!")

#Writing the for loop
#In Python, you can include a large amount of functionality in a few words. This feature makes Python relatively easy to write compared to other programming languages, but it can also make Python code more difficult to read. In this activity, you will use the for statement, but you will also spend some time analyzing it after you see it run.
#Note: Python uses indentation to determine that the print statement is inside the for loop statement.):

for x in range (0, 11):
    print(x)

#Here is an explanation of what happened in those two lines. The for statement uses the for â€¦ in keywords to tell the computer to go through the list. A list is generated by the range() function. The range() function takes a starting number and an ending number, but the ending number is not inclusive. Therefore, you pass in 11 to have the function stop counting at 10. The letter x acts as a variable. Each time through the loop, the variable x is assigned to the next variable in the loop and is printed out to the screen.
