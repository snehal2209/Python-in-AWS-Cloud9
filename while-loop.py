#Exercise 1: Working with a while loop
#A while loop makes a section of code repeat until a certain condition is met. In this exercise, you will create a Python script that asks the user to correctly guess a number.

#Printing the game rules
#Use the print() function to inform the user about your game:

import random
print("Welcome to Guess the Number!")
print("The rules are simple. I will think of a number, and you will try to guess it.")
number = random.randint(1,10)

#Track whether the user guessed your number by creating a variable called isGuessRight:

isGuessRight = False
#To handle the game logic, create a while loop:

while isGuessRight != True:
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
    if int(guess) == number:
        print("You guessed {}. That is correct! You win!".format(guess))
        isGuessRight = True
    else:
        print("You guessed {}. Sorry, that isnâ€™t it. Try again.".format(guess))

#Note: The while loop will repeat the code inside the loop until the number is guessed correctly, which is represented by the condition isGuessRight != True in the code. Additionally, Python uses indentation to determine logic blocks, or what statements are considered to be part of the while loop. You can indent a line by placing the cursor next to a statement and pressing TAB.
#Writing pseudocode
#Before you run the Python script, write out the logic of the while loop in written (non-code) sentences. This technique is called pseudocoding.

#For example:

#--If the user has not guessed the correct answer, enter the loop.
#--Ask the user for a guess.
#--the guess the correct number?
#--the correct guess, tell the user it was the correct guess and exit the loop.
#--the wrong guess, tell the user it was the wrong guess and continue the loop.
